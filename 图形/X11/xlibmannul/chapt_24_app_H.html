<HR>
<H2>
Release Notes</H2>
This appendix describes the changes between recent releases
of X Version 11. It begins with the changes in the most recent version
and works back. There were no changes in the underlying X protocol.
<BR>
<HR>
<H2>
Changes from Release 4 to Release 5</H2>
The major additions in Release 5 were support for internationalization
and support for device-independent color (the X Color Management System).
There were also a few new resource management functions added mainly to
support the R5 changes in the Xt Intrinsics.
<H3>
Internationalization</H3>
The largest new part of X11R5 is the support for writing
<I>internationalized</I> programs. An internationalized application is
one that runs, without changes to the binary, in any given "locale." Among
other things, this means that a program must display all text in the user's
language, accept input of all text in that same language, and display times,
dates, and numbers in the user's accustomed format.

<P>The internationalization of terminal-based programs is
a problem that has been satisfactorily solved where terminals exist that
can display and accept input for a particular language. The ANSI-C library
contains mechanisms for this terminal-based internationalization, and X11R5
internationalization is based on these mechanisms. Internationalized text
input is based on the concept of an "input method," which is a specialized
program that allows user input of a particular language. Input methods
are essential for Asian languages where there are more symbols than can
appear on a keyboard.

<P>Before beginning, note that the internationalization features
of X11R5 are not self contained, and therefore may not work on all systems.
If your system does not have the ANSI-C internationalization features,
you may be able to make do with alternatives provided with the Xlib sample
distribution and by contributed libraries, but these have not been thoroughly
tested and you may encounter difficulties. In ANSI-C internationalization,
the C library reads a "localization database" customized for each locale.
Many systems (systems sold in the U.S., at least) support ANSI-C internationalization,
but do not ship databases for any but a default locale.

<P>Xlib now provides:
<UL>
<LI>
Simple locale management functions.</LI>

<LI>
Routines for internationalized text-drawing.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
Font set handling functions.</LI>

<LI>
Font set metric and string measuring functions.</LI>

<LI>
String drawing functions.</LI>
</UL>

<LI>
Respecification of many Xlib functions to clarify their handling
of strings in internationalized applications.</LI>

<LI>
New functions to support internationalized window manager
and text properties for interclient communication.</LI>

<LI>
New resource manager functions to support localized databases.</LI>

<LI>
Respecifications of many resource manager functions to make
their behavior in internationalized applications clear.</LI>

<LI>
New support for internationalized text input through input
methods.</LI>

<LI>
Two sample implementations of all the new Xlib internationalization
functions.</LI>
</UL>
The X11R5 distribution provides two different implementations
of the new internationalization functions. The default implementation is
named "Xsi" and is from the OMRON Corporation; the MIT distribution builds
Xsi by default on all but Sony machines. Sony systems build the "Ximp"
implementation from Fujitsu, Sony, and others. Both "Xsi" and "Ximp" implement
the same specification,&nbsp; but are mutually incompatible. In particular,
the localization files they read are in very different formats.
<H3>
X Color Management System</H3>
Xcms defines a new syntax for the color strings used throughout
Xlib, and provides a programming interface that allows extremely precise
control over the allocation of colors. One feature of Xcms is the provision
for a database that maps color names to device-independent color specifications.
This database is read by Xlib rather than by the X server. No sample Xlib-side
database is provided in the MIT distribution. There is also a new part
of the ICCCM, the X Device Color Characterization Conventions (XDCCC),
which are a standard format for new root window properties that contains
the information about the physical characteristics of the screen necessary
to support the conversion of device-independent color specifications into
device-dependent values.

<P>Several existing Xlib functions were modified to support
this new standard syntax for color strings. The syntax allows color specification
in several international standard color spaces including CIElab, CIEluv,
and a simple color space called TEKhvc. RGB is also still supported.
<H3>
Resource Management</H3>
The character <B>?</B> may now be used in resource files
to wildcard a single component of a resource name. This allows greater
flexibility in the specification of resources.

<P>Resource files may now include other files with a C-like
<B>#include</B> syntax.

<P>A new function, <B>XrmSetDatabase()</B>, associates a
resource database with a display, and another new function, <B>XrmGetDatabase()</B>,
queries the database of a display.

<P>A function, <B>XrmLocaleOfDatabase()</B>, returns the
locale of a resource database.

<P>Two new functions, <B>XrmCombineDatabase()</B> and <B>XrmCombineFileDatabase()</B>,
merge the contents of two resource databases. They are more flexible than
the existing <B>XrmMergeDatabase</B>.

<P>A new function, <B>XrmEnumerateDatabase()</B>, iterates
through the items in a resource database.
<H3>
Scalable Font Support</H3>
Because the font server was introduced in R5, the server's
handling of <B>XListFonts()</B>, <B>XLoadFont()</B>, and <B>XLoadQueryFont()</B>
was changed to allow pattern matching for scalable fonts.
<BR>
<HR>
<H2>
Miscellaneous Xlib Changes</H2>
A new type, <B>XPointer</B>, has been defined to replace
<B>caddr_t</B>, which is not a standard type and is therefore not necessarily
portable. (The type <B>XtPointer</B> was added to the X11R4 X Toolkit for
the same reason.) An <B>XPointer</B> is a <B>typedef</B> for a <B>char
*</B>, and occurs most noticeably in the <B>XrmValue</B> and <B>XrmOptionDescRec</B>
structures.

<P>The X11R5 distribution installs the file <B>XKeysymDB</B>
in <I>/usr/lib/X11</I>. This file contains a list of vendor-private keysyms
names and their corresponding values. It is required for the correct operation
of many Motif applications and any application that wants to make use of
vendor-specific keys on a keyboard. This file was in the X11R4 distribution,
but was not installed by default.

<P>A new function, <B>XFlushGC()</B>, forces Xlib to write
its cached GC changes to the X server. For efficiency, Xlib combines multiple
GC changes into a single server request whenever multiple changes to a
GC occur before a use of that GC. It is possible for extensions to X to
use GCs in ways that Xlib is not aware of, and this can mean that requests
made by the extension client library may not operate with the expected
contents of the GC. <B>XFlushGC()</B> is provided to address this problem.

<P>The <B>XErrorEvent</B> structure used by Xlib contains
only 32 bits of data specific to the error, which is usually used to return
a resource ID. This is sufficient for all core X errors, but may not be
enough for extensions (notably PEX). There is plenty of room in the protocol
error structure that is transmitted between server and client, but Xlib
truncates this information when converting the protocol error into an <B>XErrorEvent</B>
structure. Since the <B>XErrorEvent</B> structure is smaller than the <B>XEvent</B>
union of which it is a part, an <B>XErrorEvent</B> can be cast into a larger
structure with more room for error values, and the workaround provided
by X11R5 takes advantage of this fact. X11R5 provides two new functions,
<B>XESetWireToError()</B> and <B>XESetPrintErrorValues()</B>, which allow
an extension library to register a function to convert a protocol error
into some type longer than an <B>XErrorEvent</B>, and to display an error
message that makes use of the additional data in the special error message.
<BR>
<HR>
<H2>
Changes from Release 3 to Release 4</H2>
We will begin by describing the new functions, and then we
will describe the small existing interface changes.
<H3>
New Routines</H3>
Because of the adoption of the ICCCM (<I>Inter-Client Communication
Conventions Manual</I>) as an X Consortium standard, several Xlib structures
had to be changed, and therefore, several of the R3 routines are now superceded
by new routines. All R3 routines are still supported, but the superseded
routines should not be used in new applications because they do not meet
the current conventions. Table H-1 lists the old and new routines.

&nbsp;

<P><B>XSetWMProperties()</B> is the new interface for setting
all required window manager properties. This function now sets the WM_HINTS
and WM_CLASS properties, in addition to the properties set under R3 by
<B>XSetStandardProperties()</B>. <B>Furthermore,</B> the window name and
icon name arguments are now <B>XTextProperty</B> structures that can be
filled with the new function <B>XStringListToTextProperty()</B>, described
below.

<P>All string properties to be set for the window manager
have been changed to use <B>XTextProperty</B> structures so that they can
use non-Western encodings (which require more than the eight bits of data
provided in the R3 STRING property). For this reason, <B>XGetWMIconName()</B>
replaces <B>XGetIconName()</B>, <B>XSetWMIconName()</B> replaces <B>XSetIconName()</B>,
<B>XGetWMName()</B> replaces <B>XFetchName()</B>, and <B>XSetWMName()</B>
replaces <B>XStoreName()</B>.

<P><B>XGetCommand()</B> was added to make it easier for window
managers to read the <B>XA_WM_COMMAND</B> property. In R3, <B>XSetCommand()</B>
was provided but no <B>XGetCommand()</B>.

<P>Three new fields have been added to the <B>XSizeHints</B>
structure. Two, <B>base_width</B> and <B>base_height</B>, basically supercede
the <B>min_width</B> and <B>min_height</B> fields. The <B>x</B>, <B>y</B>,
<B>width</B>, and <B>height</B> fields of <B>XSizeHints</B> are no longer
used. Instead these values are simply set when creating the top-level window
(and the window manager gets these values through substructure redirection
in <B>CreateNotify</B> and <B>MapNotify</B> events). The other new field,
<B>win_gravity</B>, allows an application to specify that some other portion
of the window is to be placed when the window manager allows the user to
place windows. The purpose of this, for example, is to allow users that
display languages that read from right to left to position the top-right
corner of these terminals instead of their top-left corner.

<P><B>XWMGeometry</B> replaces <B>XGeometry</B>. <B>XWMGeometry</B>
calculates geometry values for the top-level window, given a possibly incomplete
user-specified geometry string and a complete application default geometry
specified using an <B>XSizeHints</B> structure. <B>XWMGeometry</B> also
returns a <B>win_gravity</B> value based on which corner of the top-level
window the user or application specified, suitable for setting into the
<B>XSizeHints</B> structure.

<P>New fields have been added to the <B>XStandardColormap</B>
structure to return the visual associated with the colormap and also to
provide information about who is allowed to delete the colormap. To use
the new fields, <B>XGetStandardColormap()</B> is superceded by <B>XGetRGBColormaps()</B>
and <B>XSetStandardColormap()</B> is superceded by <B>XSetRGBColormaps()</B>.

<P>The following routines are completely new in R4.

<P><B>XSetWMClientMachine()</B> is used by clients to set
a new property to be read with <B>XGetWMClientMachine()</B> by window or
session managers. The property stores the name of the machine on which
the client is running, as seen from the server, so that the session manager
can stop and restart the client on the right machine. See Chapter 12, "Interclient
Communication."

<P><B>XSetWMProtocols()</B> is used by clients to set a new
property to be read with <B>XGetWMProtocols()</B> by the window manager.
This property indicates which of a number of window manager-client protocols
the client would like to take part in. Under these protocols, the window
manager sends synthetic events to the client to notify the client of certain
impending conditions, such as that the client has been granted the keyboard
focus or is about to have one of its windows destroyed or that the entire
client is about to be killed. See Chapter 12, "Interclient Communication."

<P><B>XSetWMColormapWindows()</B> is used by clients to set
a new property to be read with <B>XGetWMColormapWindows()</B> by the window
manager. This property tells the window manager that certain subwindows
of the client have custom colormaps that will need installing. See Chapter
12, "Interclient Communication."

<P>Five new routines are provided that allocate and zero
the fields of structures used in setting the window manager hints: <B>XAllocClassHint()</B>,
<B>XAllocIconSize()</B>, <B>XAllocSizeHints()</B>, <B>XAllocStandardColormap()</B>,
and <B>XAllocWMHints()</B>. When using these routines, an application declares
only a pointer to the structure and then uses one of these routines to
allocate the memory. The purpose of doing this is to avoid having compiled-in
structure sizes, so that fields can be added to these structures in later
releases without causing binary incompatibility. See Chapter 12, "Interclient
Communication."

<P><B>XGetGCValues()</B> reads most GC component values out
of Xlib's local cache. It does not read the dash list or clip mask. See
Chapter 5, "The Graphics Context."

<P><B>XIconifyWindow()</B> is to be called by the client
to tell the window manager to iconify a window. Similarly, <B>XWithdrawWindow()</B>
tells the window manager to unmap a window without iconifying it. These
two routines were added to simplify compliance with the new ICCCM. <B>XReconfigureWMWindow()</B>
is used by clients to reconfigure top-level windows--it works like <B>XConfigureWindow()</B>
except that it handles stacking order changes correctly even if the window
or some of its siblings have been reparented. See Chapter 12, "Interclient
Communication."

<P>As mentioned above, all of the R3 functions that write
or read string properties have been superceded by R4 functions that provide
a more flexible property format. All these new functions use the <B>XTextProperty</B>
structure. Several routines that manipulate these structures are now provided:
<B>XFreeStringList()</B>, <B>XGetTextProperty()</B>, <B>XSetTextProperty()</B>,
<B>XStringListToTextProperty()</B>, and <B>XTextPropertyToStringList()</B>.
See Chapter 12, "Interclient Communication."

<P><B>XListDepths()</B> and <B>XListPixmapFormats()</B> extract
information from the <B>Display</B> structure. These are useful when you
want to create a window or a pixmap that is not the default depth and not
a depth of one plane.

<P><B>XrmDestroyDatabase()</B> destroys a resource database,
a function that was missing in earlier releases.

<P>The <B>XScreenNumberOfScreen()</B> function has also been
added. It simply returns the screen integer corresponding to the specified
pointer to a <B>Screen</B> structure. This function is listed with the
macros in Appendix C, <I>Macros</I>, of <I>Volume Two, Xlib Reference Manual</I>.
<H3>
Existing Interface Changes</H3>
The following sections describe the changes in the areas
of <B>XOpenDisplay()</B>, error handlers, nonstandard keysyms and keyboard
groups, <B>XReadBitmapFile()</B>, resource specification syntax, and <B>XrmParseCommand()</B>.
<H4>
XOpenDisplay()</H4>
The use of <I>unix</I> as a hostname in the DISPLAY environment
variable read by <B>XOpenDisplay()</B> is no longer part of the specification
(for trademark reasons); use an empty hostname. In other words, setting
DISPLAY to ":0.0" will instruct Xlib to make the best local connection
to the server running on the same system as this client.
<H4>
Error Handlers</H4>
<B>XSetErrorHandler()</B> and <B>XIOSetErrorHandler</B> now
return the previous error handler.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE><TT>int (*XSetErrorHandler(handler))()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int (*handler)(Display *, XErrorEvent *)

int (*XSetIOErrorHandler(handler))()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int (*handler)(Display *);</TT></PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
In <B>XGetErrorDatabaseText()</B>, for an extension request,
the extension name (as given by <B>XInitExtension()</B>) followed by a
period (.) and the minor request protocol number is used for the message
argument.
<H4>
Nonstandard Keysyms</H4>
Keysyms that are not part of the Xlib standard can now be
obtained by using <B>XStringToKeysym()</B> and <B>XKeysymToString()</B>.
Note that the set of keysyms that are available in this manner and the
mechanisms by which Xlib obtains them is implementation-dependent. (In
the MIT sample implementation, the resource file <I>/usr/lib/X11/XKeysymDB</I>
is used starting in R4. The keysym name is used as the resource name, and
the resource value is the keysym value in uppercase hexadecimal.)
<H4>
XReadBitmapFile()</H4>
In <B>XReadBitmapFile()</B>, the ability to read X10 format
is no longer required of an implementation. The ability to read other than
the standard format is implementation-dependent.
<H4>
Resource Specification Syntax</H4>
As of R4, the BNF notation of a resource specification is
now specified:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp; ResourceLine&nbsp;&nbsp; =&nbsp;&nbsp; Comment|ResourceSpec
&nbsp;&nbsp; Comment&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =&nbsp;&nbsp; "!" string|&lt;empty line>&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; ResourceSpec&nbsp;&nbsp; =&nbsp;&nbsp; WhiteSpace ResourceName WhiteSpace ":" WhiteSpace value
&nbsp;&nbsp; ResourceName&nbsp;&nbsp; =&nbsp;&nbsp; [Binding] ComponentName {Binding ComponentName}
&nbsp;&nbsp; Binding&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =&nbsp;&nbsp; "."|"*"
&nbsp;&nbsp; WhiteSpace&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =&nbsp;&nbsp; {""|"Tab"}
&nbsp;&nbsp; ComponentName&nbsp; =&nbsp;&nbsp; {"a"-"z"|"A"-"Z"|"0"-"9"|"_"|"-"}
&nbsp;&nbsp; value&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =&nbsp;&nbsp; string
&nbsp;&nbsp; string&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =&nbsp;&nbsp; {&lt;any character not including "\n">}</TT></PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Note that elements enclosed in curly braces ({...}) indicate
zero or more occurrences of the enclosed elements.

<P>To allow values to contain arbitrary octets, the four-character
sequence \<I>nnn</I>, where <I>n</I> is a digit in the range of 0 through
7 is recognized and replaced with a single byte that contains this sequence
interpreted as an octal number. For example, a value containing a <B>NULL</B>
byte can be stored by specifying \000.
<H4>
XrmParseCommand()</H4>
In <B>XrmParseCommand()</B>, a new value, <B>XrmoptionSkipNArgs</B>,
has been added to the <B>XrmOptionKind</B> enum. Note that <B>XrmoptionSkipArg</B>
is equivalent to <B>XrmoptionSkipNArgs</B> with the <B>XrmOptionDescRec.value</B>
field containing the value one. Note also that the value zero for <B>XrmoptionSkipNArgs</B>
indicates that only the option itself is to be skipped.
<H4>
Keyboard Groups</H4>
In R4, the concept of keyboard groups has been introduced,
and <B>XLookupString()</B> implements new semantics to support keyboard
groups. Keyboard groups support having two complete sets of keysyms for
a keyboard. Which set will be used can be toggled using a particular key.
This is implemented by using the first two keysyms in the list for a key
as one set and the next two keysyms as the second set.

<P>The standard rules for obtaining a keysym from a <B>KeyPress</B>
event make use of only the Group 1 and Group 2 keysyms; no interpretation
of other keysyms in the list is given here. Which group to use is determined
by modifier state. Switching between groups is controlled by the keysym
named MODE SWITCH, by attaching that keysym to some keycode and attaching
that keycode to any one of the modifiers Mod1 through Mod5. This modifier
is called the "group modifier." For any keycode, Group 1 is used when the
group modifier is off and Group 2 is used when the group modifier is on.

<P>Within a group, which keysym to use is also determined
by modifier state. The first keysym is used when the Shift and Lock modifiers
are off. The second keysym is used when the Shift modifier is on, when
the Lock modifier is on and the second keysym is uppercase alphabetic,
or when the Lock modifier is on and is interpreted as Shift Lock. Otherwise,
when the Lock modifier is on and is interpreted as Caps Lock, the state
of the Shift modifier is applied first to select a keysym, but if that
keysym is lowercase alphabetic, then the corresponding uppercase keysym
is used instead.

<P>If the list of Keysyms (ignoring trailing <B>NoSymbol</B>
entries) is a single keysym "<I>K</I>," then the list is treated as if
it were the list "<I>K</I> NoSymbol <I>K</I><B>NoSymbol</B>." If the list
(ignoring trailing <B>NoSymbol</B> entries) is a pair of keysyms "<I>K1
K2</I>," then the list is treated as if it were the list "<I>K1 K2 K1 K2</I>."
If the list (ignoring trailing <B>NoSymbol</B> entries) is a triple of
keysyms "<I>K1 K2 K3</I>," then the list is treated as if it were the list
"<I>K1 K2 K3</I><B>NoSymbol</B>." When an explicit "void" element is desired
in the list, the value <B>VoidSymbol</B> can be used.

<P>The first four elements of the list are split into two
groups of keysyms. Group 1 contains the first and second keysyms; Group
2 contains the third and fourth keysyms. Within each group, if the second
element of the group is <B>NoSymbol</B>, then the group should be treated
as if the second element were the same as the first element, except when
the first element is an alphabetic keysym "<I>K</I>" for which both lowercase
and uppercase forms are defined. In that case, the group should be treated
as if the first element were the lowercase form of "<I>K</I>" and the second
element were the uppercase form of "<I>K</I>."

<P>No spatial geometry of the symbols on the key is defined
by their order in the keysym list, although a geometry might be defined
on a vendor-specific basis. The X server does not use the mapping between
keycodes and keysyms. Rather it stores it merely for reading and writing
by clients.

<P>The modifier named Lock is intended to be mapped to either
a Caps Lock or a Shift Lock key, but which one is left as application-specific
and/or user-specific. However, it is suggested that the determination be
made according to the associated keysym(s) of the corresponding keycode.
