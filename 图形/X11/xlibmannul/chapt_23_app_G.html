Sources of Additional Information</H2>
This appendix describes where you can get more information
about Xlib and about X in general, including other books on the subject
and the various ways to get the source code for X.

<P>This appendix lists a few of the official and unofficial
sources for information about the X Window System and associated software.

<P>Note that some of this detailed information may become
dated rather quickly. The best source of current information is the <I>comp.windows.x</I>
network news group, described later in this appendix.
<BR>
<HR>
<H2>
Getting the X Software</H2>
At this writing, the current public release level is Release
5. This book documents Release 4 and Release 5. Many people will continue
to use R4 for a while, since there is a considerable lag time between the
date that MIT distributes a new release and the date by which vendors integrate
that release into their own products and issue updates. All changes to
Xlib in R5 are backwards compatible, although there are many new interfaces
that provide additional capabilities.

<P>You can get the X software directly from MIT on three
9-track 1600-BPI magtapes written in UNIX <I>tar</I> format or on one 9-track
6250-BPI magtape, along with printed copies of MIT's manuals, by sending
a check in U.S. currency for U.S. $400 to:

<P>MIT Software Distribution Center
<BR>Technology Licensing Office
<BR>MIT E32-300
<BR>77 Massachusetts Avenue
<BR>Cambridge, MA 02139

<P>Their telephone number is (617) 253-6966, and the "X Ordering
Hotline" is (617) 258-8330. If you want the tapes and manuals shipped overseas,
the price is $500. The manual set alone is $125, including U.S. shipping,
or $175, including overseas shipping.

<P>Other distribution media or formats are not available
from the MIT Software Distribution Center but are from other independent
vendors such as ICS, mentioned later. The Release tape comes with source
code for sample servers for Apollo, DEC, HP, IBM, Sony, Sun, and several
other workstations, source code for clients written by MIT, sources for
the toolkits Xt, XView, Interviews, and Andrew, contributed software written
outside MIT, and sources and Postscript files for all MIT's documentation.
Note that the servers supplied are sample servers only; commercial vendors
typically release optimized (faster) servers for the same machines.

<P>Sites that have access to the Internet can retrieve the
distribution from the following machines using anonymous <I>ftp</I>. Here
are the current sites:

<P>DO NOT do anonymous <I>ftp</I> during normal business
hours, and please use the machine nearest you.

<P>The distribution is also available by UUCP from UUNET
for sites without Internet access. The files are split up to be small enough
for UUCP distribution.
<H3>
Bug Fixes</H3>
Critical bug fixes as well as a limited number of important
new features are available from the archive server <I>xstuff@expo.lcs.mit.edu</I>.
Electronic mail sent to this address is forwarded to a program which responds
with the requested information. The rest of this section and the two sections
that follow it explain how to use <I>xstuff</I>.

<P>The <I>xstuff</I> server is a mail-response program. This
means that you mail it a request and it mails back the response.

<P>The <I>xstuff</I> server is a very dumb program. It does
not have much error checking. If you do not send it commands that it understands,
it will just answer "I don't understand you."

<P>The <I>xstuff</I> server reads your entire message before
it does anything, so you can have several different commands in a single
message. It treats the "Subject:" header line just like any other line
of the message. You can use any combination of upper and lowercase letters
in the commands.

<P>The archives are organized into a series of directories
and subdirectories. Each directory has an index, and each subdirectory
has an index. The top-level index gives you an overview of what is in the
subdirectories, and the index for each subdirectory tells you what it contains.

<P>If you are bored with reading documentation and just want
to try something, then send the server a message containing the line:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE><TT>send index fixes</TT></PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
When you get the index back, it will contain the numbers
of all of the fixes and batches of fixes in the archive. Then you can send
the server another message asking it to send you the fixes that you want:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE><TT>send fixes 1 5 9 11-20</TT></PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
If you are using a mailer that understands "@" notation,
send to <I>xstuff@expo.lcs.mit.edu</I>. If your mailer deals in "!" notation,
try sending to <I>{someplace}!eddie!expo.lcs.mit.edu!xstuff.</I> For other
mailers, you're on your own.

<P>The server has four commands. Each command must be the
first word on a line.
<DL>
<DT>
<I>help</I></DT>

<DD>
The command <I>help</I> or <I>send help</I> causes the server
to send you the help file. No other commands are honored in a message that
asks for help (the server figures that you had better read the help message
before you do anything else).</DD>

<DT>
<I>index</I></DT>

<DD>
If your message contains a line whose first word is <I>index</I>,
then the server will send you the top-level index of the contents of the
archive. If there are other words on that line that match the names of
subdirectories, then the indexes for those subdirectories are sent instead
of the top-level index. For example, you can say:</DD>

<LI>
index</LI>

<DD>
or:</DD>

<LI>
index fixes</LI>

<DD>
You can then send back another message to the <I>xstuff</I>
server, using a <I>send</I> command (see below) to ask it to send you the
files whose names you learned from that list.</DD>

<DD>
<I>index fixes</I> and <I>send index fixes</I> mean the same
thing: you can use <I>send</I> instead of <I>index</I> for getting an index.</DD>

<DD>
If your message has an <I>index</I> or a <I>send index</I>
command, then all other <I>send</I> commands will be ignored. This means
that you cannot get an index and data in the same request. This is so that
index requests can be given high priority.</DD>

<DT>
<I>send</I></DT>

<DD>
If your message contains a line whose first word is <I>send</I>,
then the <I>xstuff</I> server will send you the item(s) named on the rest
of the line. To name an item, you give its directory and its name. For
example:</DD>

<LI>
send fixes 1-10</LI>

<DD>
Once you have named a category, you can put as many names
as you like on the rest of the line. They will all be taken from that category.
For example:</DD>

<LI>
send fixes 1-10 11-20 21-30</LI>

<DD>
Each <I>send</I> command can reference only one directory.
If you would like to get one fix and one of something else, you must use
two <I>send</I> commands.</DD>

<DD>
You may put as many <I>send</I> commands as you like into
one message to the server, but the more you ask for, the longer it will
take to receive. See Section G.1.1.2, "Fairness"" for an explanation. Actually,
it is not strictly true that you can put as many <I>send</I> commands as
you want into one message. If the server must use UUCP mail to send your
files, then it cannot send more than 100K bytes in one message. If you
ask for more than it can send, then it will send as much as it can and
ignore the rest.</DD>

<DT>
<I>path</I></DT>

<DD>
The <I>path</I> command exists to help in case you do not
get responses from the server when you mail to it.</DD>

<DD>
Sometimes the server is unable to return mail over the incoming
path. There are dozens of reasons why this might happen, and if you are
a true wizard, you already know what those reasons are. If you are an apprentice
wizard, you might not know all the reasons, but you might know a way to
circumvent them.</DD>

<DD>
If you put in a <I>path</I> command, then everything that
the server mails to you will be mailed to that address rather than to the
return address on your mail. The server host <I>expo.lcs.mit.edu</I> does
not have a direct UUCP connection to anywhere; you must go through <I>mit-eddie</I>
(the UUCP name of <I>eddie.mit.edu</I>) or somewhere else.</DD>
</DL>

<H4>
Notes</H4>
The <I>xstuff</I> server acknowledges every request by return
mail. If you do not get a message back in a day or two, you should assume
that something is going wrong and perhaps try a <I>path</I> command.

<P>The <I>xstuff</I> server does not respond to requests
from users named <I>root</I>, <I>system</I>, <I>daemon</I>, or <I>mailer</I>.
This is to prevent mail loops. If your name is "Bruce Root" or "Jane Daemon"
and you can document this, we will happily rewrite the server to remove
this restriction. Yes, we know about Norman Mailer and Waverley Root. Norman
doesn't use netmail and Waverley is dead.
<H4>
Fairness</H4>
The <I>xstuff</I> server contains many safeguards to ensure
that it is not monopolized by people asking for large amounts of data.
The mailer is set up so that it will send no more than a fixed amount of
data each day. If the work queue contains more requests than the day's
quota, then the unsent files will not be processed until the next day.
Whenever the mailer is run to send its day's quota, it sends the shortest
requests out first.

<P>If you have a request waiting in the work queue and you
send in another request, the new request is added to the old one (thereby
increasing its size) rather than being filed anew. This prevents you from
being able to send in a large number of small requests as a way of beating
the system.

<P>The reason for all of these quotas and limitations is
that the delivery resources are finite, and there are many people who would
like to make use of the archive.

<P>Most of these companies are preparing products based on
X. It should not be long before many different products are available that
support X.
<BR>
<HR>
<H2>
Finding Out for Yourself</H2>
X is unusual in that the source code is freely copyable by
anyone as long as the copyright notices are observed. It should be possible
for most X programmers to get a copy of the X source code from the sources
listed above. Once you understand how the code is organized, you can look
up certain details about how X works as long as you have a good knowledge
of C and a little persistence. In "Star Wars," the saying was "Use the
Force, Luke." In X, it is "Use the Source, Luke."

<P>Xlib and the server are two distinct chunks of code. Each
contains code for sending and receiving information to and from the other
over the network using protocol requests, replies, events, and errors.
The source tree as supplied on the X distribution tape places the Xlib
source in the directory <I>base/lib/X</I>, where <I>base</I> is the top
of the entire source tree. Their server source is placed in <I>base/server</I>.

<P>The procedure for finding out something about an Xlib
routine is normally to search for the routine in the Xlib code and then
figure out what it does. Sometimes the answer can be found there. Many
of the routines, however, simply place their arguments in a protocol request
and send it to the server. Then you will have to look in the server code
for the answer. To find the correct place in the server code, you will
need the symbol for the protocol request, which is the first argument in
the <B>GetReq</B> call.

<P>The server code is much more involved than Xlib itself.
The device-dependent portions are in <I>base/server/ddx</I>, and the device-independent
portions are in <I>base/server/dix</I>. The device-independent code should
be your first stop, because it is here that protocol requests from Xlib
arrive and are dispatched to the appropriate code. Search for the protocol
request symbol you found in Xlib. It will appear in several source files.
Start with the occurrence in <I>dispatch.c</I>, and try to figure out what
the code does. This will require following leads to other routines.

<P>If you do not find a routine in <I>base/server/dix</I>,
then it must be in the device-dependent code. <I>base/server/ddx</I> has
one directory in it for each brand of hardware to which a sample server
has been ported. It also contains the directories <I>/cfb</I>, <I>/mfb</I>,
<I>/mi</I>, and <I>/snf</I>, which contain routines used in writing the
sample server device-dependent code. Note that servers may include code
ostensibly for other machines. For example, the Sun sample server appears
to use code in several of the directories for other servers such as <I>dec</I>
and <I>hp</I>.

<P>Xlib and the X protocol are both defined by specification
documents, not by any particular implementation. Never depend on the implementation
details of the Xlib or server code. If you do, your code may not run on
a machine that has optimized X software. This manual documents only those
features of Xlib and X in general that are governed by X Consortium standard
specifications. If you follow the guidance you find in this volume and
the details in <I>Volume Two, Xlib Reference Manual</I>, you will be in
good shape.
